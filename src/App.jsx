        <p style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
          When the Lord overturned the captivity of Zion,
          <br />
          then were we like those who dream.
          <br />
          Then was our mouth filled with laughter
          <br />
          and our tongue with shouts of joy. Then they said among the nations,
          <br />
          &quot;The Lord has done great things for them.&quot;
          <br />
          Indeed, the Lord has done great things for us already,
          <br />
          whereof we rejoice.
          <br />
          Overturn our captivity, O Lord,
          <br />
          as when streams refresh the deserts of the south.
          <br />
          Those who sow in tears
          <br />
          shall reap with songs of joy.
          <br />
          He who goes on his way weeping and bears good seed
          <br />
          shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.

          Father, we ask that you would fill us with hospitality and love.
          Please give us genuine friendships with international students and
          help us to welcome them well. Would you give us opportunities to
          proclaim the good news about Jesus to international students and give
          those students faith to trust you. Help us to inconvenience ourselves
          to display your love to international students just as your Son gave
          up everything to serve us. <strong>Amen.</strong>
