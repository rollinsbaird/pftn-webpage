        O God, you desire that all people be saved and come to knowledge of the
        truth: Prosper all those who live, preach, and teach the Gospel at home
        and in distant lands [especially __________]; protect them in all
        perils, support them in their loneliness, sustain them in the hour of
        trial; give them your abundant grace to bear faithful witness; and endue
        them with burning zeal and love, that they may turn many to
        righteousness; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <strong>Amen.</strong>
      </p>
